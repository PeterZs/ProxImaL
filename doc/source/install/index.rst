Install Guide
=============

**To update CVXPY, first update NumPy and SciPy separately.
Then run** ``pip uninstall cvxpy; pip install cvxpy``.

**Simply running** ``pip install --upgrade cvxpy`` **can cause errors, especially if you're using Anaconda.**

Mac OS X
--------

The following instructions assume you already have Python installed.
CVXPY supports both Python 2 and Python 3.

We recommend using `Anaconda`_  rather than the Python that comes with the Mac
and installing pip, nose, NumPy, SciPy, and CVXOPT through `Anaconda`_ (i.e., ``conda install pip nose numpy scipy cvxopt``).
But it is not necessary to have `Anaconda`_ to install CVXPY,
and the instructions below assume you do not have `Anaconda`_.

1. Install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.

   Download from the `Apple developer site <http://developer.apple.com/downloads>`_.

2. If you don't have ``pip`` installed, follow the instructions `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_ to install it.

3. Install ``numpy`` with ``pip`` from the command-line.

   ::

     pip install numpy

4. Install ``cvxpy`` with ``pip`` from the command-line.

   ::

       pip install cvxpy

5. Test the installation with ``nose``.

  ::

       pip install nose
       nosetests cvxpy

Ubuntu 14.04+
-------------

The following instructions are for installing CVXPY with Python 2.
To install CVXPY with Python 3, simply install the Python 3 version of all the packages (e.g., ``python3-dev``, ``python3-pip``).

We recommend using `Anaconda`_  and installing pip, nose, NumPy, SciPy, and CVXOPT through `Anaconda`_ (i.e., ``conda install pip nose numpy scipy cvxopt``).
But it is not necessary to have `Anaconda`_ to install CVXPY,
and the instructions below assume you do not have `Anaconda`_.

1. Make sure ``apt-get`` is up-to-date.

  ::

      sudo apt-get update

2. Install ``ATLAS`` and ``gfortran`` (needed for ``SCS``).

   ::

       sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran

3. Export the location of the ``ATLAS`` installation.

   ::

       export ATLAS="/usr/lib/atlas-base/libatlas.so"

4. Install ``python-dev``.

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-dev

5. Install ``pip``.

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-pip

6. Install ``numpy`` and ``scipy``.

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy

7. Install ``cvxpy``.

   ::

       sudo pip install cvxpy

  or to install locally

   ::

      pip install --user cvxpy

8. Install ``nose``.

  ::

       sudo apt-get install python-nose

9. Test the installation with ``nose``.

  ::

       nosetests cvxpy

Windows
-------

There are two ways to install CVXPY on Windows.
One method uses Python(x,y), while the other uses Anaconda.
Installation with Python(x,y) is less likely to have problems.
Both installation methods use Python 2.

Windows with Python(x,y)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. If you have Python installed already, it's probably a good idea to remove it first.
If you uninstall Anaconda, you may need to take `extra steps to remove all traces of the Anaconda install <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15828294/problems-in-fully-uninstalling-python-2-7-from-windows-7>`_.

2. Download the `latest version of Python(x,y) <https://python-xy.github.io/downloads.html>`_.

3. Install Python(x,y). When prompted to select optional components, make sure to check CVXOPT and CVXPY, as shown below.

  .. image:: files/windows1.png
      :scale: 100%

  .. image:: files/windows2.png
      :scale: 49%

4. To test the CVXPY installation,
open Python(x,y) and launch the interactive console (highlighted button in the picture).
This will bring up a console.

  .. image:: files/windows3.png
      :scale: 100%

5. From the console, run ``nosetests cvxpy``.
If all but one of the tests pass, your installation was successful.


Windows with Anaconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Download and install the `latest version of Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. You must use the Python 2 version.

2. Download the `Visual Studio C++ compiler for Python <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_.

3. Open the Anaconda prompt and install CVXOPT by running the following command:

  ::

      conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/omnia cvxopt

4. Install SCS from the Anaconda prompt by running the following command:

  ::

      conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/omnia scs

4. Install CVXPY from the Anaconda prompt by running the following command:

  ::

      pip install cvxpy

5. From the console, run ``nosetests cvxpy``.
If all the tests pass, your installation was successful.


Other Platforms
---------------

The CVXPY installation process on other platforms is less automated and less well tested. Check `this page <https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/wiki/CVXPY-installation-instructions-for-non-standard-platforms>`_ for instructions for your platform.

Install from source
-------------------

CVXPY has the following dependencies:

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.4
* `setuptools`_ >= 1.4
* `toolz`_
* `six <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_
* `multiprocess`_
* `CVXOPT`_ >= 1.1.6
* `ECOS`_ >= 2
* `SCS`_ >= 1.1.3
* `NumPy`_ >= 1.8
* `SciPy`_ >= 0.15
* `CVXcanon`_ >= 0.0.22

To test the CVXPY installation, you additionally need `Nose`_.

CVXPY automatically installs `ECOS`_, `CVXOPT`_, `SCS`_, `toolz`_, and
`multiprocess`_. `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_ will need to be installed manually.
You may also wish to install `Swig`_ to build `CVXcanon`_ from source.
Once youâ€™ve installed
`NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_, installing CVXPY from source is simple:

1. Clone the `CVXPY git repository`_.
2. Navigate to the top-level of the cloned directory and run

   ::

       python setup.py install

Install with Elemental support
------------------------------

CVXPY supports the Elemental solver.
Simply install Elemental such that you can ``import El`` in Python.
See the `Elemental <http://libelemental.org/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with GUROBI support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the GUROBI solver.
Simply install GUROBI such that you can ``import gurobipy`` in Python.
See the `GUROBI <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with MOSEK support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the MOSEK solver.
Simply install MOSEK such that you can ``import mosek`` in Python.
See the `MOSEK <https://www.mosek.com/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with GLPK support
-------------------------

CVXPY supports the GLPK solver, but only if CVXOPT is installed with GLPK bindings. To install CVXPY and its dependencies with GLPK support, follow these instructions:

1. Install `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_. We recommend either installing the latest GLPK from source or using a package manager such as apt-get on Ubuntu and homebrew on OS X.

2. Install `CVXOPT`_ with GLPK bindings.

    ::

      CVXOPT_BUILD_GLPK=1
      CVXOPT_GLPK_LIB_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/lib
      CVXOPT_GLPK_INC_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/include
      pip install cvxopt

3. Follow the standard installation procedure to install CVXPY and its remaining dependencies.


Install with Cbc (Clp, Cgl) support
-----------------------------------
CVXPY supports the `Cbc <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_ solver (which includes Clp and Cgl) with the help of `cylp <https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP>`_.
Simply install cylp (you will need the Cbc sources which includes `Cgl <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_) such you can import this library in Python.
See the `cylp documentation <http://mpy.github.io/CyLPdoc/>`_ for installation instructions.
